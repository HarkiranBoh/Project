How was the website implemented?

The slide show on the top of the page was implemented using JavaScript to change
the images with a button.

The images on the page was structured using flex box.

Validations

The index.html and all the styles have been validated
the html file was validated from: https://validator.w3.org/ and was passed successfully.
The CSS file was validated https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and passed successfully, with a few warnings.


Things I wanted to do

I wanted to put text over the slider so it would change as you would click the image. This proved difficult to do as my knowledge of JavaScript is minimal.

I also wanted to incorporate form validation but I did not have access to the jQuery or angular JS to do this effectively.

I watched a YouTube video referenced below for the coding of my website.
